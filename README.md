# Sudoku Solver in Python 🧠

This is a Python project that implements a backtracking Sudoku solver. It can solve pre-defined boards, check board validity, and even generate random Sudoku puzzles with partial fills.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `sudoku.py` – The main script containing all logic: validation, solving, and printing.
- `solved_soduko` – A file that contains the solutions (or errors) of the test boards.

## 🧩 Features

- Solves partially filled Sudoku boards.
- Checks for board validity (no duplicate digits in rows, columns, or 3x3 squares).
- Generates a random board with 10–20 initial digits.
- Saves solutions to a file.
- Asks the user for input when multiple choices are possible.

## ▶️ How to Run

### 1. Clone the repo:
```bash
